# What?

PySight2MISP is a project that can be run to be used as glue between [iSight intel API](https://docs.fireeye.com/iSight/index.html) and [MISP API](https://github.com/CIRCL/PyMISP)

# Status

This script is not maintaned - if you want to use it, there might be a need to fix a lot of stuff before, but still happy to accept PR

# Why

To get the indicators, IOCs etc from iSight to the MISP system

# How

    see INSTALL.md
    
You do not need an iSight Account to test the script, there will be test data to test with e.g. a MISP VM.

# Roadmap

## short term

* fix [Issues](issues)
* add C2 as individual attribute based tag

## long term

* migrate stuff to an MISP import module
